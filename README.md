# Payzee
As a team, we came up with a series of technologies to be able to cut wait time to pay for your bill after you have eaten at a restaurant. By using your phone, the customer should be able to tap on a smart table to open a tab with the restaurant. After you have finished eaten, you can pay for your food immediately using the Mastercard's api. We built this app in mind to be able to efficiently pay for your bill without unnecessary wait time.  I developed an android application that is able to open the tab after connecting to the table and receiving a unique id using the phone's NFC technologies. I also used Mastercard's places and location API to be able to detect all the restaurants nearby that accepts constactless pay. I used Mastercard's Simplify api to handle the transaction when the user pays for the tabs. It is the primary source of interaction with the user so I developed it with the customer experience in mind.
